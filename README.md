## Usage Tips

1. **For OBS**: Open the player page in a browser source
2. **For Control**: Use the remote page on your phone or secondary device
3. **Multiple Instances**: You can have multiple remote controls connected
4. **Playlist Organization**: Name your playlist folders descriptively
5. **File Naming**: Use proper ID3 tags for best results, or clean filenames

## Troubleshooting

- **No music playing**: Check that MP3 files are in the playlists directory
- **Connection issues**: Ensure port 3000 is available
- **Metadata missing**: Verify MP3 files have proper ID3 tags
- **Page not loading**: Check that the server is running
